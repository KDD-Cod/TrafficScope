# Rebuttal -- Towards Context-Aware Traffic Classification via Time-Wavelet Fusion Network

## Usable Information of Packet Byte

We deliver a theoretical analysis of usable information theory to explain and analyze the information of packet bytes.

## Anonymization

We anonymize the header byte, such as IP, MAC, checksums, and the sequence number. We show the specific anonymous fields in the figure below.
